# Web Security Scanner


A comprehensive Java-based web security scanner designed to identify common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF vulnerabilities, and Sensitive Information Exposure. Built with Spring Boot for modularity and enterprise-grade features.

## üöÄ Features

- **SQL Injection Detection**: Identifies potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting various payloads into URL parameters and forms
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection**: Detects XSS vulnerabilities by injecting XSS payloads into URL parameters and checking for their reflection in the response
- **CSRF Protection Testing**: Comprehensive CSRF token validation and same-site cookie testing
- **Sensitive Information Exposure**: Scans web page content for patterns indicative of sensitive data like email addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, API keys, and credit card numbers
- **Web Crawler**: Intelligent web crawler that navigates through the target website to discover and scan multiple pages
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting to avoid overwhelming target servers
- **Configurable Scanning**: Flexible configuration system for payloads, patterns, and scan settings
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed vulnerability reports with color-coded output
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage of scan results using H2 database
- **Spring Boot Architecture**: Enterprise-grade architecture with dependency injection and configuration management

## How to Build

To build the project, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## How to Run

**Important:** The scanner CLI is disabled by default for flexibility. To run the scanner from the command line, you must enable it by passing `-Dscanner.cli.enabled=true`.

You can run the scanner by providing a target URL as a command-line argument.

**Example Usage:**

To scan a target website (e.g., `http://example.com`):

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="http://example.com" -Dscanner.cli.enabled=true
```

Or, after building the JAR:

```bash
java -jar target/web-security-scanner-<version>.jar http://example.com --scanner.cli.enabled=true
```

**Exit Code Configuration:**

By default, the scanner always exits with code 0 (success) when the scan completes successfully, regardless of whether vulnerabilities are found. This allows the scanner to be used in CI/CD pipelines without failing the build based on vulnerability detection.

To make the scanner exit with a non-zero code when vulnerabilities are found (useful for security gates in CI/CD):

```bash
# Using Maven
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="http://example.com" -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dscanner.cli.fail-on-vulnerabilities=true" -Dscanner.cli.enabled=true

# Using JAR
java -jar target/web-security-scanner-<version>.jar http://example.com --scanner.cli.enabled=true --scanner.cli.fail-on-vulnerabilities=true
```

With `fail-on-vulnerabilities=true`:
- Exit code 0: No vulnerabilities found
- Exit code 1: Vulnerabilities found
- Exit code 2: Scan error occurred

**Testing with a Vulnerable Website:**

For testing purposes, you can use a known vulnerable website like `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/`. This will demonstrate the scanner's ability to detect various vulnerabilities.

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="http://testphp.vulnweb.com" -Dscanner.cli.enabled=true
```

or

```bash
java -jar target/web-security-scanner-<version>.jar http://testphp.vulnweb.com --scanner.cli.enabled=true
```

The scanner will output detected vulnerabilities directly to the console.

## üìä Configuration

The scanner uses Spring Boot's externalized configuration system. You can customize scanning behavior through:

### Application Properties

- **`application.yml`**: Main configuration file with default settings
- **`application-test.yml`**: Test-specific configuration
- **`scanner.cli.enabled`**: Enable/disable CLI mode (default: true)
- **`scanner.cli.fail-on-vulnerabilities`**: Exit with non-zero code when vulnerabilities are found (default: false)

### Configurable Settings

- **SQL Injection Payloads**: Customize SQL injection test payloads
- **XSS Payloads**: Configure XSS detection patterns
- **Sensitive Data Patterns**: Regular expressions for detecting sensitive information
- **Scan Settings**: Max depth, timeout, rate limiting
- **CSRF Settings**: Token validation rules and cookie policies

### Example Configuration

```yaml
scanner:
  cli:
    enabled: true
    auto-shutdown: true
    fail-on-vulnerabilities: false  # Set to true for CI/CD security gates
  scanSettings:
    maxDepth: 3
    timeoutSeconds: 30
    rateLimitRequestsPerSecond: 3
  csrfSettings:
    testForms: true
    checkSameSiteCookies: true
    minimumTokenLength: 16
```

## üß™ Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Code Formatting

This project uses Google Java Format to maintain consistent code style.

### Automatic Formatting

Code is automatically formatted during the Maven build process. The formatter runs in the `process-sources` phase.

### Manual Formatting

To manually format all Java files:

```bash
mvn com.spotify.fmt:fmt-maven-plugin:format
```

### Check Formatting

To check if all files are properly formatted without making changes:

```bash
mvn com.spotify.fmt:fmt-maven-plugin:check
```

This command will fail if any files are not properly formatted, which is useful for CI/CD pipelines.

### IDE Integration

For local development, it's recommended to install the Google Java Format plugin for your IDE:

- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Install the "google-java-format" plugin
- **Eclipse**: Install the Google Java Format plugin
- **VS Code**: Install the "Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat" extension with Google Java Format support


## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting prevents overwhelming target servers
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Prevents hanging requests
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- **No Persistent Attacks**: The scanner performs read-only vulnerability detection

## üìà Performance

- **Concurrent Scanning**: Multi-threaded scanning for improved performance
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming processing of large responses
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable depth and timeout settings
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient HTTP connection management
